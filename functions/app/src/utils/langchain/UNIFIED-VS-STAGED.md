# Comparison: Two-Stage vs. Unified Approach

This document compares the two-stage approach (separate calls for expense classification and tool calling) with the unified approach (single model call for both).

## Approaches

### Two-Stage Approach

1. **First Stage**: Classify input as expense or question
2. **Second Stage**: If question, use tool calling to process

### Unified Approach

1. **Single Stage**: Use a single model call with all tools bound, including an expense classification tool

## Pros and Cons

### Two-Stage Approach

#### Pros:

- **Specialized Prompting**: Each stage has a focused prompt optimized for its specific task
- **Clearer Separation of Concerns**: Classification logic is separate from tool calling logic
- **Potentially Higher Accuracy**: Specialized prompts may lead to better results for each task
- **Simpler Error Handling**: Errors in one stage don't affect the other stage
- **Easier to Debug**: Clear separation makes it easier to identify where issues occur

#### Cons:

- **Higher Latency**: Two API calls mean higher overall latency
- **Higher Cost**: More API calls mean higher cost
- **More Complex Code**: Need to manage multiple stages and their interactions
- **Potential Inconsistencies**: The two stages might make contradictory decisions

### Unified Approach

#### Pros:

- **Lower Latency**: Single API call reduces overall latency
- **Lower Cost**: Fewer API calls mean lower cost
- **Simpler Code**: Less code to manage with a single flow
- **Consistent Decision Making**: One model makes all decisions, ensuring consistency
- **More Modern Approach**: Aligns better with current LLM best practices

#### Cons:

- **Complex Prompting**: Need to balance instructions for both classification and tool calling
- **Harder to Debug**: Issues may be harder to isolate when everything happens in one call
- **Potential for Confusion**: Model might get confused about when to classify vs. use tools
- **Less Specialized**: May not perform as well on each specific task

## When to Use Each Approach

### Use Two-Stage Approach When:

- Accuracy is more important than latency or cost
- You need highly specialized behavior for each stage
- Debugging and monitoring each step separately is important
- The tasks are significantly different and require different contexts

### Use Unified Approach When:

- Latency and cost are critical factors
- The tasks are related and can share context
- You want to simplify the codebase
- You're working with more advanced models that can handle complex instructions

## Implementation Considerations

### For Two-Stage:

- Optimize each prompt for its specific task
- Consider caching the classification result to avoid redundant calls
- Implement robust error handling between stages

### For Unified:

- Carefully design tool descriptions to help the model choose correctly
- Use clear system instructions that address both tasks
- Prioritize tools in a logical order (classification first, then query tools)

## Recommendation

For most modern LLM applications, the **unified approach** is generally preferred due to:

1. Lower latency and cost
2. Simpler implementation
3. Better alignment with how modern LLMs are designed to work

However, if you observe that the unified approach is not performing well for your specific use case, the two-stage approach offers more control and specialization at the cost of additional API calls.
